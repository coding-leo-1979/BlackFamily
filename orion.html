    <img src="orion_1.jpg" width="1000">
    <br><br>&nbsp;Orion Black (1929 â€“ 1979) was a British pure-blood wizard. He was the only son of Arcturus Black III and Melania Macmillan. He was the senior male-line descendant of the House of Black, a family which could trace its magical ancestors back to at least the Middle Ages and which was recognised as one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.
    <br><br>&nbsp;He married his second cousin, Walburga Black, and the couple had two sons: Sirius and Regulus Black. Both his sons were heroes of the Wizarding Wars.
