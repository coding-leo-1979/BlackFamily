    <h2>Regulus Arcturus Black</h2>
    <img src="regulus_1.jpg" width="1000">
    <br><br>&nbsp;<a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Regulus_Black" target="_blank" title="Regulus Black wiki">Regulus</a>’ parents considered him to be much different from his older brother <strong>Sirius Black</strong>. Although Sirius was the older son and heir, he didn’t in any way whatsoever follow the Black family traditions, unlike Regulus. Regulus was admired by his parents for his loyalty towards his family and upholding their tradition. He was a member of the elite Slug Club and attended Hogwarts from 1972 to 1979.
    <br><br>&nbsp;From a young age, Regulus admired Lord Voldemort and had an ambition to become a Death Eater later on in his life. Regulus had photos and articles about the Dark Lord and his followers cut from the Daily Prophet, which were hung in his bedroom near a painting of his family crest. Regulus received his Dark Mark around the age of 16, which his family approved of as Voldemort was seen as striving to achieve pure-blood supremacy over other wizards and Muggles. Even though his parents were never Death Eaters themselves, they agreed with many of Lord Voldemort’s own beliefs.
    <br><br>&nbsp;After becoming a Death Eater, Regulus began to consider abandoning Lord Voldemort, partly because his master mistreated and intended to kill Kreacher, whilst setting up the security measures for one of his Horcruxes.
    <br><br>&nbsp;By 1979, Regulus had begun to have doubts about serving as a Death Eater, but was reluctant to act against the Death Eaters and Voldemort. One day, Voldemort asked Regulus for the use of his house-elf and he accepted. Voldemort used Kreacher to test the defences around his locket Horcrux, leaving him to die afterwards. Kreacher was able to escape using house-elf magic, and told Regulus of what had happened. Regulus worked out that the locket was a Horcrux and was the reason behind Voldemort’s immortality.
    <br><br>&nbsp;This was the deciding factor in Regulus’ defection. He created a duplicate of the locket and placed a note inside for anyone wanting to destroy the Horcrux to find, and then ordered Kreacher to take him to where the real locket was hidden. Kreacher guided Regulus past the cave's defences. At the island with the basin of potion containing the locket, Regulus ordered Kreacher to take the locket once the potion was gone and replace it with the fake one, then escape without him and find a way to destroy the Horcrux. Regulus drank the potion himself, and when he tried to get water from the lake to quench his thirst, he was dragged to his death by the Inferi. Kreacher obeyed his master's final order and switched the lockets before escaping. However, despite his best efforts, he was unable to destroy the Horcrux.
